# soundvisuals

this is my first project in Django, I have used this little idea to learn how Django works and how to deploy it on Heroku via github.
the finished app can be found here:
https://dry-sea-37473.herokuapp.com/

the app generates sounds using 3 pure waves at different frequencies selected by user and then it displays graphically the resulting sound in both time and frequency domains

things that I have learned in this project:
- what is Django and how to use it, remotely and via Heroku
- how to do a Heroku deployment
- how to convert a normal html+js+php website into Django, so to integrate python scripts
- how to generate sounds using mathematical signals
- how to create charts starting from a wave file

things that I did not manage to fix: 
- creation of files and charts "on the fly": the app saves everything to images and wavefile, which are displayed in a different webpage...  I am still not clear if charts can be generated on the fly like I typically do with googlecharts on a js based website
